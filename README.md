## About
This project is a simple study as how to implement a Node.js and Socket.io multiplayer game. React was used to build the UI for the client. This is a really simple implementation of both server, client and game logic. This is not a production ready software in any manner. No support is offered to fix bugs, code is made available "as is". Feel free to clone this repo and make your own customizations.

## To-dos:
This is a list of things I *want* to implement, but are out of the scope of this project for now:

#### Frontend
- [ ] Implement Redux
- [ ] Improve components code
- [ ] Improve the overall UI design
- [ ] Implement multiple card answers
- [ ] Implement chat component
- [ ] Improve error handling

#### Backend
- [ ] Improve server code (refactor)
- [ ] Improve game code (refactor)
